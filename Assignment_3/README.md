## Running the Code
Navigate to the `main.py` file. Within, there are 3 user inputs, `vehicle`, `start`, and `parking_spot`: 

* `vehicle`: `string` - This can be one of three options: ["skid", "car", "truck"]. "Skid" for the delivery robot, "car" for the police car, and "truck" for the truck and trailer

* `start`: `tuple` - This is the starting point for the vehicle in the format (x, y, theta) where theta is the orientation of the vehicle in radians. 

* `parking_spot`: `tuple` - This is the goal position for the vehicle.
